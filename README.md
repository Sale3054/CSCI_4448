Small scale Pizza Parlor web app.

In order to run this, you need Flask and Python2.7 or later. 

Follow the base instructions to set up Flask.

Then, the following will be necessary:
1. Create your environment variable
2. As of Flask 1.2, I believe, you need to use `set FLASK_APP=pizza.py flask run`

There is documentation within the AutoDoc folder.
Everything is likewise heavily commented.

All of the Auto-Generated documentation can be found within the `\AutoDoc Files\` folder. Unfortunately, Pydoc doesn't play nice with Flask so that all does not have any generated documentation. Neat little program, though.

In templates you will find all of the relevant HTML pages (read, two of them). There are likewise a few junk pages that I was using to to learn Flask as I was going, but you can ignore those, if the main page does not call it, it is not important.

Further, there is a myriad of python docs with ingredient names. Those are each of the class docs for the ingredients.
