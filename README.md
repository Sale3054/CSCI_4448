Small scale Pizza Parlor web app.

In order to run this, you need Flask and Python2.7 or later. 

Follow the base instructions to set up Flask.

Then, the following will be necessary:
1. Create your environment variable
2. As of Flask 1.2, I believe, you need to use `set FLASK_APP=pizza.py`
3. `set FLASK_ENV=development`
4. `flask-run app`
